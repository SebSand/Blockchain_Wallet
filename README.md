# Blockchain_Wallet

# This project assumes the perspective of a Fintech Finder
# customer in order to do the following:

# * Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase
# (which you created earlier in the module).

# * Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account
# address.

# * Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas
# estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

# * Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send
# this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

# * Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

# Once you receive the transaction’s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions
# section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. To confirm that
# you have successfully created the transaction, you will save screenshots to the
# README.md file of your GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.

# Step 1:
# Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application

# This section imports several functions from the `crypto_wallet.py`
# script into the file `fintech_finder.py`, which contains code for Fintech
# Finder’s customer interface, in order to add wallet operations to the
# application. For this section, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech
# Finder customer (i.e., you’ll provide your Ethereum wallet and account
# information to the application).

# Complete the following steps:

# 1. Review the code contained in the `crypto_wallet.py` script file. Note that
# the Ethereum transaction functions that you have built throughout this
# module-including `wallet`, `wallet.derive_acount`, `get_balance`, `fromWei`,
# `estimateGas`, `sendRawTransaction`, and others&mdash;have now been
# incorporated into Python functions that allow you to automate the process of
# accessing them.

# 2. Add your mnemonic seed phrase (provided by Ganache) to the starter code’s `SAMPLE.env` file.
# When the information has been added, rename the file `.env`.

# 3. Import the following functions from the `crypto_wallet.py` file:
# * `generate_account`
# * `get_balance`
# * `send_transaction`

# 4. Within the Streamlit sidebar section of code, create a variable named
# `account`. Set this variable equal to a call on the `generate_account`
# function. This function will create the Fintech Finder customer’s (in this
# case, your) HD wallet and Ethereum account.

# 5. Within this same section of the `fintech_finder.py` file, define a
# new `st.sidebar.write` function that will display the balance of the
# customer’s account. Inside this function, call the `get_balance` function
# and pass it your Ethereum `account.address`.
